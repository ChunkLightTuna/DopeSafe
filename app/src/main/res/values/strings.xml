    <string name="disclaimer">Disclaimer</string>
    <string name="conditions">
    1. The use of any opiate drug is an inherently dangerous activity with real and
    significant risks of injury and death.\n\n
    2. The app user further acknowledges that the risks of opiate use are increased when
    the user is alone at the time of use.\n\n
    3. That many opiates are illegal to possess and also, to supply and manufacture.\n\n
    4. That this app in no way encourages, endorses or condones the use of opiates,
    including those which are illegal to possess, supply and manufacture.\n\n
    5. That while this app is intended to assist opiate users to reduce the risk of harm
    through accidental overdose, it is not failsafe. Even when using the app, opiate
    use remains a dangerous activity.\n\n
    6. That the app, like all forms of software, is subject to malfunction and may not
    work as intended or at all on particular occasions depending upon matters such
    as the memory capacity of the device onto which it is downloaded, phone network
    coverage, device charge and the app userâ€™s data allowance. Additionally, the app
    works by sending a message to a third party and relies on that third party
    receiving the message and responding in a timely manner.\n\n
    7. That the app user freely and voluntarily accepts the risks associated with opiate
    use and releases, to the full extent permitted by law, XX from any liability for
    injury or death occurring as a result of opiate use while he or she is using this
    app.\n\n
    8. That the app user may rely on the above acknowledgements and releases in any
    proceedings brought against it by the app user, his or her estate and his or her
    family members arising out of his or her injury or death.\n
