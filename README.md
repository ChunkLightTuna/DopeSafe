# DopeSafe
Our mission is to create a safety net for users. A way to give a peace of mind to family and friends. We know that it can be hard to quit, and we want you to be able to feel confident that there is a way and there is still people out that care about you. We want to give you the power to do something about it even if you canâ€™t physically do it yourself.

## Current Features
DopeSafe includes an automatic timer that when set and counts down, it will immediately alert family, friends, or even the authority if you so choose it. It includes customization for the timers gives you the option to alert as many people as you want.

## How to work on this project
1. `git clone https://github.com/TeamSeabiscuit/DopeSafe.git`
2. Open it up on your preferred Android IDE and jump into it!


## Easy team workflow
#### **Please make sure you read this instruction before you push any changes.**
1. Clone the base project:         
`git clone https://github.com/TeamSeabiscuit/DopeSafe.git`
2. Make sure you create a new branch (based on development/master branch) every time you want to push a new fix or update. This won't be conflicted with everyone:                       
`git checkout -b your_branch master`                            
We decided to follow this naming convention for git branch name: your initial + version number. i.e: **jnn_v1**
3. Add any (files) change to the stage:                   
`git add .`
4. Then commit your change:                    
`git commit -m "your comment"`
5. Push changes to your new branch:                     
`git push -u origin your_branch`
6. Before we decide to merge with master, you need to `git push` to make sure that the central repo has your current commit.
7. After you push your code, make sure you pull request in github GUI so everyone knows what you changed.
8. Then we can decide to merge the change:
```
git checkout master
git pull
git pull origin your_branch
git push
```
